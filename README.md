INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
---

Click the buttons (they say what they do on them), and watch the turtle create the drawing.
Some extra explaining is needed for the recording buttons, though: The Start Recording button will start recording Turtle code to a file that is created via a save box that pops up, and the End Recording button will stop recording the code. And the arrow key control: toggle it, and you get more exact movement (5 pixels), albiet being a bit sloppy and uncontrollable at times. You can only use 90 degree angles with it, though.
