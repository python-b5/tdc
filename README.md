INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
---

Click the buttons (they say what they do on them), and watch the turtle create the drawing.
Some extra explaining is needed for the recording buttons arrow key control, and custom buttons, though: The Start Recording button will start recording Turtle code to a file that is created via a save box that pops up, and the End Recording button will stop recording the code. The arrow key control: toggle it, and you get more exact movement (5 pixels), although being a bit sloppy and uncontrollable at times. You can only use 90 degree angles with it, though. For custom buttons: Custom Button Settings will let you change settings for various commands (RGB for color), which can be run with the Custom Buttons button.

Don't redistribute these saves. They are demos made purely to show what you can do with different features. Run them (their only dependencies are Turtle (Python 3) and Python 3, along with other saves made with tdc), and...well, enjoy the art!
