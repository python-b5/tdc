INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

Click the buttons (they say what they do on them), and watch the turtle create the drawing.
Some extra explaining is needed for the recording buttons, though: The Start Recording button will start recording Turtle code to a file that is created via a save box that pops up, and the End Recording button will stop recording the code.
