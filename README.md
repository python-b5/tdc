INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
---

Click the buttons (they say what they do on them), and watch the turtle create the drawing.
Some extra explaining is needed for the recording buttons, though: you will need an empty file already on your computer (this may be changed later). Then the Start Recording button will start recording Turtle code to a selected file, and the End Recording button will stop recording the code.
